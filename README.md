Jerry:
My name is Jerry Caleb and did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at Karunya University. I worked in Valeo as a Simulation Engineer for 5 years. During my tenure there I did few scripting activities and eventually got to know about data analytics and ML. I started exploring that and did a project in our company. Slowly I developed interest in Machine Learning and wanted to learn more in detail and practically and so I opted for this course. I love to play mobile games like Call of Duty Mobile and Clash Royale and the love for gaming has united us all.

Nghia:
My name is Nghia Phan, and I also go by Nicolas. I'm from Vietnam. I have my bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics. I have been working as a software engineer, with primary focus on backend technologies such as Java, Spring Boot and Quarkus. I chose this master's program because of its emphasis on practicality: two co-op semesters, industrial instructors and plenty of networking opportunities.
