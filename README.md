Jerry:
My name is Jerry Caleb and did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at Karunya University. I worked in Valeo as a Simulation Engineer for 5 years. During my tenure there I did few scripting activities and eventually got to know about data analytics and ML. I started exploring that and did a project in our company. Slowly I developed interest in Machine Learning and wanted to learn more in detail and practically and so I opted for this course. I love to play mobile games like Call of Duty Mobile and Clash Royale and the love for gaming has united us all.

Nghia:
Nghia Phan, from Vietnam.
I choose this program because of its practicality, such as there are 2 co-ops, industrial instructors in class, so it helps me professionally.
